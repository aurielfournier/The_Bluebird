# The_Bluebird
Rail data extracted from season reports in Missouri Audubon's newsletter 'The Bluebird'

I am working on a project to combine this data with my own dissertation data to assess any changes in rail abundance over the years. 

The Bluebird is not readily available online (in really any form except the most recent issues). So I got a bunch of them through ILL and made this data file by reading the season reports of each year and recording all the records of King, Yellow, Black, Virginia Rail or Sora.
